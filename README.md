Currently Known Bugs:
Your README will contain a list of all known bugs in your program. For each bug, include a brief
description of when it is occurring (compile, link, or runtime), when the bug first showed up, the
symptoms the bug is giving off, and how you attempted to fix it. Undocumented bugs will incur a
greater penalty.
Demonstrating that you understand why a program has a bug, even if you are unsure of how to fix it,
shows that you are thorough. An undocumented bug shows that you do not understand the program, or
that you tried to hide a flaw. Undocumented bugs only slow down future development.
Known bugs and unfinished portions of the project
• Special considerations or anything I should know when grading your solution
◦ Any completed extra credit must be documented in the README to receive credit
